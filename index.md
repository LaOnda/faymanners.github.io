Hi, my name is Fay Manners and I am the director of BadManners Ltd. I have a BSc degree in Information Science and six years experience of working with data. I have worked out of the London and New York headquarters for Unilever plc and have also worked out of the Reading IT development offices for MediaSift Ltd. With the exception of hating Ben & Jerry's ice cream and being addicted to the trading card game Magic: The Gathering, my brain has grown a lot.

When I am not fixated to my laptop I can be found in the mountains. I currently specialise in analysing and visualising social data and also backcountry snowboarding in the Alps.
